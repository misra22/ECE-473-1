    "## 1. Background\n",
    "In this assignment, we are trying to do simple sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. Itâ€™s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using is called [***Stanford Sentiment Treebank***](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html). This dataset is collected from movie reviews on *Rotten Tomatoes* for over 20k sentences. All reviews later got re-organized as distinct phrases with label as number 0.0 to 1.0. Labels can later be divided in to five intervals [0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8], (0.8, 1.0] which means very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using in this assignment is a subset of Stanford Sentiment Treebank and consists of **400 phrases**. Train-test dataset split ratio is 50/50 and for either train or test dataset, half of them are extremely positive reviews (have corresponding range (0.9, 1.0]), and the other half are extremely negative reviews (have corresponding range [0.0, 0.1]). Your job is to construct a simple function that takes a single phrase in and outputs whether this phrase has positive or negative sentiment. You can inspect the training dataset to understand the types of phrases that are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of this assignment is to attempt to implement a method from the 1st wave of AI, namely handcrafted knowledge systems. Thus, you will be trying to create a rule-based function for this task based on your prior knowledge and some examples from the training dataset.**"
